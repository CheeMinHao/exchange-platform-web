# What is it
1. A platform where users are able to exchange products as they have second hand products that they no longer wish to use
2. Example are clothes and shoes. Often we have extra things in our closet that we no longer wear. Instead of selling it for half the price,
    we can exchange it on the marketplace at full price.
3. The world is full of unused clothing and shoes that we no longer want to wear but still in good condition. We want to prevent wastage of clothes
    and people are constantly buying new clothes every month causing wastage.

## How the platform works
1. When you register on the platform everyone gets 100 points (equivalent value to USD100). This is a cashless marketplace. There is no cash transacted in the platform.
2. You list your clothing on the platform selling your clothes for 50 points. You can choose to sell your clothes at any points you wish
3. Anyone can purcahse your clothes at the points you set. Once they purcahse you deliver the clothes to them at your cost
4. You now have 150 points and you can purchase any clothes on the platform.
