# What is it
1. A platform where users are able to exchange products as they have second hand products that they no longer wish to use
2. Example are clothes and shoes. Often we have extra things in our closet that we no longer wear. Instead of selling it for half the price, 
    we can exchange it on the marketplace at full price. 
3. The world is full of unused clothing and shoes that we no longer want to wear but still in good condition. We want to prevent wastage of clothes
    and people are constantly buying new clothes every month causing wastage.
